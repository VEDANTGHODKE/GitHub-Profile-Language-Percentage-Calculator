# GitHub Profile Languages

This application is for all GitHub users to create a nice pie chart of their programming languages from their GitHub profile.


## How to Use

Open the [this page in your browser](http://vedantghodke.github.io/GitHub-Profile-Language-Percentage-Calculator) and write in the textbox a GitHub username you want to fetch the programming languages graph.

Wait until the data is fetched, and then you can view a robust pie chart representation of any user's profile languages!

You can embed the resultant pie chart, just click <kbd>Embed</kbd> and copy the embed code in your page.

You can also share the pie chart on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn.
